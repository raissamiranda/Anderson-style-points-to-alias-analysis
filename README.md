# Anderson-style-points-to-alias-analysis
Alias analysis is a "may" static analysis that approximates the set of memory locations that each pointer can point to. Thus, the goal of this analysis is to build a table, henceforth called an environment that associates each pointer p with the memory locations that p can point to.
